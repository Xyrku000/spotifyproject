# spotifyproject
I made my Spotify project in this repository.
You must make a Spotify app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login.
Then copy your credentials to lines 9 through 11 (where I have mine already in that spot).
Make sure you have node.js installed.
Use the Terminal of your computer and run it in node.
